# MoonShot Technologies - Reinforcement Learning Projects

Welcome to the MoonShot Technologies (MST) Reinforcement Learning Projects repository! Here at MST, we're on a mission to achieve a technological marvel â€” a lunar landing using reinforcement learning. As a reinforcement learning engineer, you're at the forefront of this endeavor.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to create a lunar lander environment, train an agent to master lunar landings, and optimize this agent for real-world deployment. Here's a brief overview of the key projects:

### Project 1: Creating an Environment

In this project, we'll build a realistic lunar lander environment. The software engineering team has provided us with essential functions for velocity, angle, position, landing zone, and fuel calculations. Your task is to structure the reward signal based on specific criteria such as crash conditions and fuel conservation.

### Project 2: Implement your Agent

We've extended our reinforcement learning knowledge to control tasks using a neural network for function approximation. You'll implement an agent capable of lunar landing using a neural network for action-values instead of state-values. We'll utilize the Adam optimizer, experience replay buffers, and softmax action-selection to build an Expected Sarsa agent. Your mission is to solve the Lunar Lander challenge using this agent.

### Project 3: Meta-Parameter Analysis

In this project, we'll delve into the impact of meta-parameters on agent performance, specifically focusing on the step-size parameter. Through careful experiments, we aim to gain insights into how different parameter values affect the agent's performance.

## Project Structure

Our repository is structured into distinct projects, each with its own purpose and set of tasks. You'll find detailed instructions, code, and explanations in each project folder. Feel free to explore, contribute, and experiment as we work towards achieving our lunar landing goal.

## Credits

We owe credit to the University of Alberta for their invaluable reinforcement learning courses on Coursera, which have provided the foundational knowledge and inspiration for these projects.

Join us on this exciting journey as we apply reinforcement learning to accomplish the extraordinary! Together, we'll make MoonShot Technologies' lunar landing dreams a reality.
